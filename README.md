# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

ðŸ’¡ Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project!** ðŸ’¡

This is my **first** end-to-end data analytics project. A milestone in my journey to becoming a **data analyst**.

It demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, from designing and building the data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Through this project, I applied real-world data engineering and analytics principles while following industry best practices and modern methodologies.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### *Objective*

Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, consolidating sales data from multiple systems to support analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.

#### *Specifications*

- **Data Sources**: Ingest data from two core systems (ERP and CRM) provided as *CSV* files.

- **Data Quality**: Apply data-cleaning logic using SQL functions such as TRIM(), NULLIF(), and COALESCE() to handle missing or inconsistent values.

- **Integration**: Use JOINs, CTEs, and UNIONs to merge both data sources into a single data model optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset snapshot for current insights; historization and change-tracking not required.

- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business *stakeholders* and *analytics teams*.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### *Objective*

Develop SQL-based analytics and business intelligence reports to uncover actionable insights on:

- **Customer Behavior**: identify retention patterns, purchase frequency, and churn indicators using window functions like RANK() and LAG().

- **Product Performance**: calculate KPIs such as revenue contribution and profitability by product category.

- **Sales Trends**: analyze growth over time using date aggregation and rolling averages.


These analytical queries deliver key performance metrics and data-backed insights to support strategic decision-making across teams.
